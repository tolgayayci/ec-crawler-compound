# Electric Capital Crypto Ecosystems Crawler

## Overview

This crawler script, designed for the Electric Capital Crypto Ecosystems repository, automates the process of updating the list of Compound-related projects on GitHub. It identifies new projects using specific Compound dependencies, compares them with the existing list in compound.toml, and creates a pull request in the Electric Capital repository with new projects list of Compound.

## Features

- **Automated GitHub Crawling:** Searches for specific Compound-related keywords in package.json, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, and .sol files.
- **Intelligent Filtering:** Adds only new projects not already listed in compound.toml.
- **Automated Pull Requests:** Creates a pull request with updates on a forked Electric Capital repository.
- **Rate Limit Handling:** Manages GitHub API rate limits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requirements.txt
- A GitHub personal access token

## Setup

1. **Environment Variables:** Set ```GITHUB_TOKEN``` and ```GITHUB_USERNAME``` in a .env file. (You can copy .env.example to .env, and edit it)

## Usage

Run ```python3 main.py``` on the root folder. The script then,

1. Initializes and loads environment variables.
2. Searches GitHub for repositories with specified Compound-related criteria.
3. Compares and filters found repositories against compound.toml.
4. Synchronizes the forked repository with the upstream repository.
5. Creates a pull request with new entries in the forked repository.

## Output

- Logs of the process.
- A link to pull request in the forked repository with compound.toml updates.
